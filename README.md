# 📌 Data Structures Helper Functions

## 🚀 Overview
This repository was created to help **AltSchool Africa students** better understand **data structures** while working on their assignments. Many students encountered difficulties, so I decided to build this **structured guide** to make learning easier.

This repo contains:
✅ **Helper Functions** – Clean, well-structured code that solves each task.
✅ **Detailed Explanations** – Step-by-step breakdown of what each function does.
✅ **Common Errors & Fixes** – Lessons from mistakes and how to avoid them.

## 📢 Why I Built This
I created this project **to help my fellow students** who struggled with the **first-semester Data Structures guided project** at AltSchool Africa. The goal is to make learning easier, encourage problem-solving, and promote **peer-to-peer support**. 

Unfortunately, I wasn’t able to complete and submit my assignment before the deadline due to the **limitations of not having a personal computer**. Even while working on this helper function repository, I had to **borrow a laptop just to do what I love doing—helping others and improving my skills.**

I can’t wait for everything to fall into place so I can **help more people, learn even faster, and contribute more meaningfully to the tech community.** Until then, I’ll keep pushing forward with what I have! 🚀

If this repo helps you, **give it a ⭐ star on GitHub** and share it with someone who needs it! 🚀
